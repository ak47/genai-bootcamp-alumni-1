AGENTS Development Guidelines
==============================

- All non-frontend code must be written in Python.
- All Python code must target Python 3.10 or newer.
- Use project-internal types for annotations instead of the standard `typing` library.
- Build all frontend code with TypeScript and SvelteKit.
